Code is incomplete but I figured I should turn in what I have.
Not worth trying to compile anything except p1.vhd which I tested (see screenshot). 
p2.vhd is in a state half way between two different methods I was trying. Couldn't get this to work with unconstrained size array.
Problems 4 and 5 are in the hw6 pdf.
